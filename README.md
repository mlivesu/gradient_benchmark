## A Comparison of Methods for Gradient Field Estimation on Simplicial Meshes

This is the benchmark used to run the experiments described in the paper:

```
A Comparison of Methods for Gradient Field Estimation on Simplicial Meshes
Claudio Mancinelli, Marco Livesu, Enrico Puppo
Computers & Graphics, 2019
```

The software consists of two executables: one GUI that allows to visualize the error distribution using heatmaps, and one batch program to run experiments and compute numbers (output results are encoded in a .csv file). The software depends from  [CinoLib](https://github.com/mlivesu/cinolib) for geometry processing, and from [Qt](https://www.qt.io) for visualization.

If you use results from this paper in your academic project, please consider citing:
